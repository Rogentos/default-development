gentoo-chroot-development
=========================

ISO chroot-only for Gentoo Ebuild and Utilities Development.
Overlay of ebuilds for the necessary packages to be added in the ISO.

Full details about development in Gentoo in http://devmanual.gentoo.org/

Details about creating or editing ebuilds in http://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/index.html

Naturally, this is a Sabayon base system (that means lots of packages were built by the Sabayon team via Portage and packaged via Entropy package manager),
so it automatically comes with a Entropy installed with full development repositories + the overlays from which the packages were built with Portage.
Documentation for Entropy Binary PM: http://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=En:Entropy
Also, the procedure in which packages are created and handled by Entropy is called mixing, and the documentation: http://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Safely_mix_Entropy_and_Portage

And of course, the Gentoo Handbook http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/

To install it as an overlay in a Gentoo planet distro, use the command: 

layman -f -a default-development -o https://raw.github.com/Rogentos/default-development/master/overlay.xml
